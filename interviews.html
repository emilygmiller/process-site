					<h2>Leslie Miller</h2>
					<p class="info">Mom, Educator</p>
				</header>

				<p><strong>1. Who are you? What do you do?</strong><br>
					My name is Leslie and I work in education. </p>

				<p><strong>2. Have you ever volunteered with or donated to Toys for Tots or another organization that
						focuses on toy drives/collection of Christmas gifts for children in need?</strong><br>
						In previous years, I have donated to Toys for Tots as well as other toy drives for children at Christmas time.  Most of the time my donations have been through church for Operation Christmas Child or for a specific family of children in need (angel tree).  Schools that my children have attended would often collect Toys for Tots at musical and other school events prior to Christmas. </p>

				<p><strong>3. What led you to volunteer with or donate to this organization? </strong><br>
					Having taught lower income children, I have seen the sadness after Christmas when there wasn’t a favorite or special toy/gift. I liked seeing schools promote giving and hoped that my kids were seeing many people put others first as we donated to Toys for Tots.</p>


				<p><strong>4. How did serving in this way impact you? </strong><br>
					Giving to others always has a positive impact on me and I wanted my kids to have the same feeling. Giving and feeling that we make a difference to another person/family takes the focus off of our selfishness. </p>

				<p><strong>5. What is your view on the importance of providing kids with toys that would otherwise go
						without at Christmas?</strong><br>
						Christmas can be a fun time of year with presents under the tree but not all children have that experience. I want children to have cool toys just like their friends.</p>

				<p><strong>6. What is your main goal in visiting an organization’s website?</strong><br>
					When I visit an organization’s website, I am really looking for information.  How can I donate?  What do they do with the donations?  Are they being good stewards of donations?</p>

				<p><strong>7. What matters to you about a website?</strong><br>
					I want websites to be user friendly - easy to find things, current information, correct information and free of grammar/spelling errors. </p>

				<p><strong>8. How often do you make a decision based on the way a website looks? </strong><br>
					I’m sure there is a part of me that sticks with a website due to how pleasing it is to the eye but I’m not conscious of that.  If I become frustrated with finding information or start to see old or incorrect information, I leave the website.  </p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>This interview helped me see the positive impact that giving to children in need has on families that are more fortunate and have the ability to give. It also gave me a lot of important insight about needing a user-friendly website where information about the organization and how to donate is clear and easy to find. </p>

					<h2>Amelia Young</h2>
					<p class="info">Student, Future Educator</p>
				</header>

				<p><strong>1. Who are you? What do you do?</strong><br>
					My name is Amelia Young and I am a senior elementary education major. I am currently student teaching in a 3rd grade classroom within Title 1 elementary school. </p>

				<p><strong>2. Have you ever volunteered with or donated to Toys for Tots or another organization that
						focuses on toy drives/collection of Christmas gifts for children in need?</strong><br>
						Yes, my church and the schools that I have worked in have partnered with many different organizations in order to help collect toys for children in need. I also helped lead a toy drive for Toys for Tots in high school.</p>

				<p><strong>3. What led you to volunteer with or donate to this organization? </strong><br>
					I have always had a big heart for kids in need. So, I love any organization that works to help and provide for kids that are growing up in hard situations.</p>


				<p><strong>4. How did serving in this way impact you? </strong><br>
					I want to spend my life working with at-risk kids. I think that taking care of children is one of the most important jobs that we are given as Christ followers.</p>

				<p><strong>5. What is your view on the importance of providing kids with toys that would otherwise go
						without at Christmas?</strong><br>
						I believe that every Child is made in God’s image; therefore, I think that every child should be seen and taken care of in the upmost regard.  </p>

				<p><strong>6. What is your main goal in visiting an organization’s website?</strong><br>
					My main goal when visiting an organizations website is to be able to have a clear understanding of what they do and who they are as an organization.</p>

				<p><strong>7. What matters to you about a website?</strong><br>
					I think that being able to understand the mission/vision statement for an organization is very important. If I am looking to partner with an organization, I want to be able to see why they exist and the heart of their organization. I also think it is important to be able to easily see what opportunities there are for volunteers. Some websites make it really hard for people to see how to volunteer. </p>

				<p><strong>8. How often do you make a decision based on the way a website looks? </strong><br>
					I make a lot of my decisions on how a website looks. I think that you can learn a lot about an organization and their priorities through how well-developed the website is and what they choose to put on the home page as the first thing people see. </p>

			<br>
			<p>This interview gave me a lot of good perspective on the importance of having clear information about the organization’s mission in an easy to find spot on the website. I think that this interview helped me understand that for a user visiting the Toys for Tots website, finding information about the organization is most important and after that, knowing clearly how to get involved with donating or volunteering for the organization is also really important.</p>

			<hr>

			<div>
				<p>Overall, I think these interviews with potential users of the website helped me to gain a better understanding of what the call to actions buttons should be on the website’s homepage and the importance of clear information about the organization’s mission. They showed me that understanding an organization’s mission and how they’re stewarding their donations is an important thing for users to find in a website before they look for ways to donate. It’s also clearly important that information on how to donate or volunteer should be central in the website’s homepage.</p>
