				<h2>Determining Audience</h3>
				<p>Sticky Note</p>
			</header>

			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/AudienceCategories.jpg" alt="" /></span>The first step in this process was to list all the groups that are directly involved with Toys for Tots, all of the groups that are peripherally involved, and all of the fans/critics of the organization. Listing these categories helped me visualize all of the possible groups that are impacted by this organization and who have a connection with the work they’re doing.</p><br>
				<p><strong>Directly Involved:</strong> <br>
				-	Less fortunate children <br>
				-	Less fortunate families <br>
				-	Marine corps reserve <br>
				-	Parents <br>
				-	People who donate toys <br>
				-	Financial donors <br>
				-	Volunteers for collection/distribution <br>
				-	Parents requesting toys <br>
				-	Local community organizers <br>
				
				<strong>Peripherally Involved:</strong> <br>
				-	More fortunate families <br>
				-	Partner organizations <br>
				-	Collection sites corporate sponsors <br>
				-	Schools, churches, local campaigns
				</p>
				

				
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DirectRelation.jpg" alt="" /></span>Next, I organized these audience groups into categories. Under the groups that were directly involved, I separated them into the categories of receiving toys, giving, and organizing. </p> <br>

				<p><strong>Receiving toys: </strong><br>
					-	Parents requesting toys <br>
					-	Parents <br>
					-	Less fortunate families <br>
					-	Less fortunate children <br>
					
					<strong>Giving:</strong><br>
					-	People who donate toys <br>
					-	Financial donors <br>
					-	More fortunate families <br>
					
					<strong>Organizing:</strong> <br>
					-	Marine corps reserve <br>
					-	Volunteers for collection/distribution <br>
					-	Local community organizations <br>
					-	Collection sites <br>
					-	Lead of local campaigns (marine, sailor or volunteer) <br>
