					<p>The first step in this process was to list all the groups that are directly involved with Toys for Tots, all of the
						groups that are peripherally involved, and all of the fans/critics of the organization. Listing
						these categories helped me visualize all of the possible groups that are impacted by this
						organization and who have a connection with the work they’re doing.</p>
						<p><strong>Directly Involved:</strong> <br>
							- Less fortunate children <br>
							- Less fortunate families <br>
							- Marine corps reserve <br>
							- Parents <br>
							- People who donate toys <br>
							- Financial donors <br>
							- Volunteers for collection/distribution <br>
							- Parents requesting toys <br>
							- Local community organizers <br>
		
							<strong>Peripherally Involved:</strong> <br>
							- More fortunate families <br>
							- Partner organizations <br>
							- Collection sites corporate sponsors <br>
							- Schools, churches, local campaigns

					<p>Next, I organized these
						audience groups into categories. Under the groups that were directly involved, I separated them into
						the categories of receiving toys, giving, and organizing.</p>
						<p><strong>Receiving toys: </strong><br>
							- Parents requesting toys <br>
							- Parents <br>
							- Less fortunate families <br>
							- Less fortunate children <br>
		
							<strong>Giving:</strong><br>
