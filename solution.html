				<p>For my site, I decided to make 2 primary CTAs for the homepage. These were “Learn More” and “Get
					Involved”. From my interviews and research about the audience of this site, I think that it’s most
					important for there to be a clear link to more information about the organization and what their
					mission is along with a clear step for someone looking to get involved with the organization. With
					neither of these being significantly more important than the other, I chose to make them both solid
					colors, but different from each other to show their distinction. I also put the “Learn More” button
					on the left, because most likely people coming to explore this organization’s page will want to read
					more information on what they’re about before deciding to get involved with their mission. But, if
					someone is coming to the site knowing that they want to get involved in some way, they will clearly
					find a button to take them to information about how they can get involved. This call to action would
					direct the user to information about donation, volunteering, and finding a local campaign of Toys
					for Tots. I also chose to include a CTA button that says “donate” to remain at the top of the page
					no matter where someone is on the website. I think that this is important because it is something
					that people can always reach while navigating the site, and if a user is coming with the intent of
					donating, it is clearly marked at the top of the page with the rest of the menu options.</p>
