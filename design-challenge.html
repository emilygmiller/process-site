						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">Using the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit as a guide to narrow down the problem I'm aiming to solve.</p>
					</header>
					<p><strong>What is the problem you’re trying to solve?</strong> <br>
						Send a message of joy and hope to less fortunate children through the collection and distribution of toys for them to receive at Christmas. </p>
						
					<p>	<strong>1.	Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</strong> <br>
						How can less fortunate kids receive joy and hope through a gift of a toy at Christmas that they would otherwise go without? And, how can the online presence be elevated to make this as easy and widespread as possible? </p>

					<p><strong>2.	Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have. </strong> <br>
						Giving the greatest number of less fortunate kids in different communities the opportunity to feel joy and hope at Christmas through something as simple as a new toy. Creating the opportunity for as many less fortunate kids as possible to have access to this gift.</p>
					<p><strong>3.	What are some possible solutions to your problem?</strong> <br>
						Have a clear opening page to the website that would send the user to two options: one for someone looking to donate (financially or donate a toy) and someone looking to receive toys for their children. Giving the website an elevated visual appeal through engaging imagery and an updated look to feel cleaner. Giving hierarchy to the content that is in the website to make it easier to navigate and to make the user experience more straightforward. Having a clear way to contact the local organization so people can get plugged into the campaign in their own community. </p>
					
					<p>	<strong>4.	Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing. </strong> <br>
						Lots of content on the website to organize. The train imagery in the logo has a recognizable quality. Not straying from that, but still elevating the visual look of the brand. The organization is run through the United States Marine Corps – does the visual language have to coincide with that of the Marines? </p>

					<p><strong>	5.	Does your original question need a tweak? Try in again.</strong> <br>
						How do I create a place where people can easily access the opportunities to donate to a cause of giving toys to less fortunate kids, and those that are in need can easily access the opportunity to receive toys for Christmas through a more straightforward and clean visual language in the website?
