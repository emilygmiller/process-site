					<p>Who is Toys for Toys? What are they doing that matters?</p>
				</header>
			</header>

			<p>Toys for Tots is a nonprofit organization run by the US Marine Corps that collects and donates toys for
				kids who come from low-income families and would not otherwise get presents on Christmas. The goal of
				this organization is to spread the joy of Christmas to all kids and give the opportunity for kids in
				need to experience the same joy that others get to experience on Christmas morning. There are local
				groups of this organization in counties all across the US, that collect toys in their local communities
				to donate to kids in their area.</p>

			<p>From the initial research about the client, I gained a lot of insight about their presence on their
				website and in their presence in other contexts that collateral is being designed for. One of the
				biggest insights that I gained from collecting images of these various contexts was that the design
				feels dated and limited in the ways that it can be adapted into different contexts and locations. While
				the train logo is logical for the organization being focused on collecting toys for kids, I think there
				is an opportunity for it to be cleaned up and possibly be given a newer look and feel. The main imagery
				that I noticed was the train in the logo, and the bears that are wearing the Marine uniform. Besides
				these things, there aren’t many graphic elements or imagery being used in the website that can help the
				user experience. The red found in the logo is used consistently throughout the website and in their
				other various collateral, but there is little variety in the colors that provides interest for the
				viewer. The red and blue are pulled from the fact that this organization is part of the US Marine Corps,
				which is an important aspect to remember when looking at the client’s presence online and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>The main thing that I noticed about their website is that there is no clear hierarchy in the information
				being presented, which makes it hard for the viewer to navigate. There is a lot of information being
				communicated in different categories and they are split up by different pages, different containers for
				the articles, and sections of the website. The organization of the information is there, but I think
				there is a lot of room for visual improvement in the established organization and division of content.
				There are a lot of small boxes and containers where the preview to an article is held, or the content is
				placed in. While it’s organized, it’s hard to know what to read and navigate through because it’s just a
				lot of blocks of these containers throughout the website. There isn’t much appealing imagery on the
				website, but there is space to work it in. I also think that there is opportunity to implement a cleaner
				look and feel for the branding and overall visual presence of the organization in order to make it more
				interesting for a viewer and to provide more chances to create a visual presence outside of the website
				(which seems to be limited currently).</p>

			<p>From looking thoroughly through the website, I gained a lot of insight about what the goals of the
				organization are and what things should be prioritized visually. The main purpose of the website seems
				to be connecting the user with a chance to donate, a local organization near them where they can
				physically donate or connecting families in need with the opportunity to receive a toy. Apart from the
				information about the organization and what they’ve done, these are the most important parts of the
				website’s function. I think that creating more hierarchy here could help elevate their user experience
				and overall function and navigation of the website.

				<h1>Secondary Research</h1>
				<p>Exploring what solutions exist to this problem.</p>

			</header>

			<p><strong>1. Explore the most recent news in your client's field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines,
					or journals to know what’s new. This can be news stories of interest, relevant scientific research,
					or anything that could help you in finding a solution to the design challenge.</strong>

			<p>For over 70 years, the Marine Corps Reserve unit in the Marine Corps has led annual Toys for Tots
				donation drives for their local communities. Currently, the program distributes an average of 18 million
				toys to less fortunate children annually. Their foundation is currently funded by over 50 national
				corporate sponsors, and they currently have a support ratio of 97:3 (meaning that 97% of donations are
				spent on the program and 3% on overhead costs). Including 2020’s collection and donation campaign, Toys
				for Tots has now distributed 604 million toys and books to 272 million less fortunate children since
				their founding in 1947.</p>

			<p>Recent stories about Toys for Tots also deal with other outreach incentives that they have backed and
				contribute to. They have developed a partnership with Good360 through the creation of “emotional
				support” packages that are ready to be donated during natural disasters to help kids cope with the
				stress of those situations. They also have an ongoing partnership with The UPS store in their Literacy
				Program that provides books to less fortunate children. In their 2021 newsletter, they explain the plan
				they have to provide STEAM ,/related toys and supporting equipment in the spring and summer to support
				their “unplug and play” initiative.</p>
			</p>

			<p><strong>2. Try to find recent innovations in your client's particular area. They could be technological,
					behavioral, or cultural.</strong></p>

			<p>In 2020, the program was impacted by COVID19 in unique ways. At the height of the pandemic, they made the
				decision to donate 2 million toys that they had collected so far to families in need instead of waiting
				to use them at Christmas. This was impactful to children in bringing them joy and returning some amount
				of normalcy to their lives. This was an important decision they made, but it also greatly reduced their
				inventory for the Christmas distribution of toys that was coming up. Donations were made in
				extraordinary amounts and there was a record number of 20.2 million toys donated to 7.4 million children
				who would have otherwise gone without.</p>

			<p>With the pandemic, collection and distribution of toys had to take a different approach in most
				communities. Whether it was curbside or drive through collection and distribution or enlisting the
				support of other local social service organizations because of the limit on number of volunteers to work
				through the collection and distribution of toys, the mission of providing joy for less fortunate
				children through new toys was accomplished in record breaking amounts.</p>

			<p><strong>3. Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there
					any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of
					your own? </strong></p>

			<p>Samaritan’s Purse’s Operation Christmas Child is an organization that has a successful solution to this
				issue and their digital presence as an organization. The home page of this website instantly directs the
				user to a call to action of either “start building” and “give for others to build” with a few other
				action buttons. Below that, there is a section that gives the user a overview of what the organization
				does with engaging imagery and a video that ties into the content. The call-to-action button is at the
				bottom of the home page as well. The simplicity of this homepage makes the user navigation easier and
				more straightforward. The rest of the content on the website can be found through the navigation bar at
				the top and the pages that you can navigate to take the same simple form that is easy for user to
				navigate and is also engaging to view. I think that the simplicity of how this website is formatted is
				something that I will implement into my design for Toys for Tots, specifically the landing page with a
				clear call to action. </p>

			<p><strong>4. Is there any market data that you can dig up that may be relevant in helping you solve the
					design challenge?</strong></p>

			<p>- Approximately 1 in 5 children live below the poverty level (almost 15 million children in the Nation)
				https://www.toysfortots.org/about_toys_for_tots/toys_for_tots_foundation/WEBfnl_16pgs_Sum2020_TFTNWS.PDF
				<br>
				- The child poverty rate is one and a half times higher than that for adults (age 18-64)<br>
				- 71% of children in poverty are children of color <br>
				- An additional eight million Americans, including 2.5 million children, have fallen into poverty since
				May 2020. <br>
				- https://www.childrensdefense.org/state-of-americas-children/soac-2021-child-poverty/ <br>
				- A study of 2,500 working age people shows 52% of parents are worried about how they will fund
				Christmas <br>
				- One in 10 cannot afford heating or food, one in 8 cannot afford rent or mortgage costs, and one in
				four can’t afford travel to see friends or family <br>
				- Around 90-95% of Americans celebrate Christmas and around 22% of Americans live below the poverty
				level. Meaning, many of these children will go without presents for Christmas</p>
